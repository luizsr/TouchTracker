TouchTracker
============

Big Nerd Ranch's iOS dev book's example app, TouchTracker, written in Swift.

This (along with my other Big Nerd Ranch projects) are my first taste of MVC and iOS, so please let me know how I can improve my solutions, and try not to judge too much!

The implemented challenges are probably not ideal MVC/iOS dev practices; they ask one to do what they haven't been taught or shown yet, so any of my additions are a little rough around the edges.

But hey, I'm having a great time coding iOS apps with Swift, and can't wait to learn more!
